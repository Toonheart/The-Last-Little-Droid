The-Last-Little-Droid
=====================

A droid survives blast of his home planet, and gets thrown in a transwarp (space travel portal) and lands on distance planet Earth.

His surveillance panel shows that a Droidina (female Droid) survived the blast too and is somewhere light years away.

He needs to find his way via transwarp to Droidina and mate with her to re-populate Droidland.
